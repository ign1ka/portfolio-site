title: About Me
---

I am a recent graduate of Pomona College with a degree in physics and astronomy. I have both an interest in and experience with digital technologies.  I taught myself computer science skills through the use of the Unity game engine, and I learned the fundamentals of audio engineering through personal music projects using Ableton Live. I have strong problem solving and interpersonal skills, and I hope to continue to build upon my abilities in the future. This website displays a number of projects I have worked on independently or contributed to. My contact information can be found below, should my diverse skill set be of interest to you or your company.
